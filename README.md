# Otel Observability Stack

The **Otel Observability Stack** is a comprehensive solution for monitoring and tracing applications using OpenTelemetry. This project provides a pre-configured setup to collect, process, and visualize telemetry data, enabling better insights into application performance and reliability.

---

## Features

- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end visibility into application requests.
- **Metrics Collection**: Gather and analyze application and system metrics.
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging for easier debugging.
- **Extensibility**: Easily integrate with other observability tools.
- **Pre-configured Dashboards**: Ready-to-use visualizations for quick insights.

---

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Basic knowledge of OpenTelemetry concepts.
- Sufficient system resources to run the stack.
